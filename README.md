# DijkstraShortestPath

DijkstraShortestPath is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two points.  

## Installation

Download as .zip and extract.

Ensure the java path is set and you're using Java jdk-17+

Open this folder in command prompt and execute the following:

```
java DijkstraShortestPath
```

## Usage

To input data directly from the console, type 'direct' at the program start. You can then enter the cities and their distances in the format 'source, distance, destination', or type 'stop' to finish.

```java
//Enter nodes and their connections like so

s, 5, t1
t1, 3, t2
t2, 1, f

//When finished enter stop

stop
```
If you choose to input from a CSV file, type 'file' and then provide the file path when prompted.
